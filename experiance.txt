//understand the question properly(what we need to find)
//workout sample inputs with hand
//think along with constarints
//is ok to brute force or simulate
//write generalized statements
//understand i/o properly
//dont debug the code too much rewrite
//there should some progess with every 5 mins
//properly write the math equations in paper
//if recursive appraoch is not working then try iterative approach
//use calculater not google search
//every problems may be different but not difficult
//thinking in reverse direction might work
//with binary search think in reverse direction
//either sorting or multiset and multimap when it comes sorting
//if sample explaination is not given then it may be possible to misinterpret the question
//think wether u are over complicating question ?
//seperate code and logic, apply presence of mind seperately
//understand and code dont simply type
//create seperate files for each problem, each one with fresh template
//check wether it is asked to take modulo or not 
//control ur emotions, dont be exicted dont be sad, if confusing try to think properly
